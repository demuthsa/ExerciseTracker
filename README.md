# User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, reps, weight, unit of mass, and date exercise was performed.
# Description
MERN stack app used to write a Single Page Application (SPA) that tracks exercises completed by the user. I used React for the front-end UI app and REST API using Node and Express for the back-end web service while using MongoDB for persistence.
